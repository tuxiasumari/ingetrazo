"""Group: a self-contained chunk of geometry with its own mesh.

The scene's main mesh welds every coincident vertex (sticky geometry), so a
block drawn against a wall fuses with it. A Group isolates geometry into its
*own* :class:`~core.mesh.Mesh` (still in world coordinates for now — no instance
transform yet, that's Components): nothing welds across the group boundary, so it
moves and edits as a unit without dragging the rest of the model.

Selected as a unit and moved/exploded via the commands in :mod:`core.history`.
