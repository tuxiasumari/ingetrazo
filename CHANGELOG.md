# Changelog

All notable changes to IngeTrazo are documented here.
Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-16

Open SketchUp files directly: File ▸ Import ▸ SketchUp (.skp)…

### Added
- **Direct `.skp` import** through the external `skp2dae` converter — run as
  a separate process (the proprietary Trimble DLL never enters the GPL
  tree). The `.dae` and its texture folder land next to the `.skp`, then the
  existing COLLADA importer takes over (groups, components, textures,
  face-me sprites). On Linux the converter runs via Wine.
- **One-click converter install**: if `skp2dae` is missing, the import
  dialog offers to install it automatically — the converter executable is
  downloaded from the IngeTrazo release and the SketchUp runtime DLLs from
  the Blender "SketchUp Importer" add-on's public release, into
  `~/.local/share/skp2dae/`. No terminal required.

### Fixed
- `.skp` files stored under accented paths (`Imágenes`, `ñ`…) failed with a
  UTF-8 decode error — Wine re-encodes command-line arguments to the
  Windows ANSI codepage. The conversion now routes through an ASCII
  temporary path and tolerates any output encoding.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-15

The BIM release: the IFC bridge to IngePresupuestos is validated end to end,
SketchUp models migrate with textures and components, the terrain workflow
takes real field data — and the UI grew into its SketchUp skin.

### BIM → IFC (the thesis, closed)
- **Per-class base quantities** (`Qto_*BaseQuantities`): walls report net
  side area + height/length/width, slabs area + thickness + perimeter,
  columns/beams volume + length + cross-section, doors/windows real leaf
  dimensions (also as `OverallHeight/Width` attributes), piles/members/
  railings by the metre via `IfcQuantityLength`.
- **IFC4 export validated against a real consumer**: ifcopenshell parses it
  with zero schema/EXPRESS issues, tessellates every body, reads the
  quantity sets — permanent in the test suite.
- **The bridge works**: a tagged model imported by IngePresupuestos' IFC
  importer lands every takeoff EXACT (walls in m², columns in m³, piles by
  the metre, doors by the unit) — also a permanent cross-repo test.
- **Tag as you draw** (active class): arm a class in the BIM panel and every
  trace assumes it — one BIM object per trace, honest per-object takeoffs.
  Push/pull extends a tagged base to the solid it raises.
- The BIM panel now shows the **budget measure per object** (10.40 m²,
  0.31 m³, 1 und) instead of the misleading shell area.

### Bring your SketchUp models
- **COLLADA (.dae) import with real textures**: per-face UV maps from the
  file's TEXCOORDs, texture-tolerant coplanar fusion (no dirty
  triangulations), representative colours when the image folder is missing.
- **SketchUp's group structure survives**: one Group per assembly (a plaza
  imports as 291 groups, not one blob) — click selects the lamppost, not
  the world; edit by entering the small group.
- **Components import as shared instances**: one prototype mesh, N
  transforms (16 instances/6 prototypes saved 59k faces on a real nursery
  project; import went 24.7 → 10.8 s).
- **Face-me sprites recovered**: the cutout people/trees SketchUp exports
  without the flag turn toward the camera again, with SketchUp-style
  selection outlines and snap anchors (feet, head).
- **Big-model interaction**: vectorised pick index (2138 → 22 ms), per-group
  render/pick chunks, one-draw-call faces — a 394k-triangle plaza orbits
  at 60 fps and a 17k-triangle building imports in 0.8 s.

### Terrain, from field data
- **Survey-point CSV import** (P,N,E,Z,desc in UTM — GPS/total station):
  points become snappable reference markers; the pencil lands bit-exact on
  the surveyed coordinate. Anchors the scene datum at the first point.
- **Named XYZ sources, saved forever** (QGIS-style): add a tile source once
  with a name and it is always in the menu, each with its own tile cache;
  the last-used source restores on startup.
- The Georef tab is now **Terreno** — the trade's word.

### New tools
- **Text (X)**: leader-text annotations — the prompt prefills with the
  clicked edge's length, face's area, or point coordinates (SketchUp-style);
  occluded leaders, selectable, saved in `.igz`.
- **3D Text**: real extruded geometry from any system font — one watertight
  solid per letter (counters preserved), smooth thickness, glued to the
  face under the cursor (a relief sign on a wall, text lying on a slab).
- **Hi-res image export** (File ▸ Export ▸ Image): the current view at any
  pixel width through the exact render pipeline, presentation overlays
  included — 4K sheets straight from the program.
- **Component placement with the cursor**: inserts follow the mouse and
  settle on the ground plane (or any face you point at); Esc discards.

### UI, SketchUp-shaped
- Menu bar reorganized to mirror SketchUp: **Archivo · Edición · Cámara ·
  Dibujo · Herramientas · Ventana · Ayuda** (Draw groups Arcs/Shapes,
  Camera owns views/projection/orbit, Window owns panels + language).
- **Components tray panel** with static image thumbnails (no 3D rendering
  to show them), replacing the File-menu submenu.
- File menu unified into **Import** and **Export** submenus (survey CSV
  included); duplicate dock titles above the tray tabs removed.

### Fixes
- Graze intersections snap to the vertex they graze (tangent circles).
- Lines drawn on a populated plane run the scoped rebuild (no stacked
  inverted faces).
- A slit edge deletes the line and keeps the face.
- Face attrs (textures, colours, layers, IFC tags) travel through Make
  Group / Explode.
- MSAA moved into the scene FBO — first real antialiasing.
- Orbiting with dimensions visible: occlusion test cached + vectorised
  (280 → 6 ms/frame).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-11

The first release. A usable, free, Linux-first SketchUp-style 3D modeler for
civil engineering and architecture — draw → model → tag → take off → export.

### Modeling engine
- Shared-vertex non-manifold topology engine (SketchUp's model): sticky
  geometry, automatic welding, face detection, planar-arrangement rebuilds.
- Push/Pull with the full solid pipeline: recess, steps, through-holes,
  clamps, distance inference, Ctrl = copy, double-click repeats — and the
  **BIM-grade watertightness guard**: the engine never commits a broken
  solid (ambiguous operations are refused safely, and told to the user).
- Robust curve entities: circles, polygons, 4 arc types; curves select as
  whole contours, split at intersections, survive copy/paste/offset/groups.
- Deterministic intersections: circle×line, circle×circle, rect×rect split
  into proper regions — on flat drawings, next to solids, and on solid faces.
- Transactional command history: any internal failure rolls back to the
  exact previous state, tells the user, and logs to `ingetrazo-errors.log`.
- Fuzz-tested: 1000 seeded operation sequences with structural invariants
  (watertightness, orientation, undo fidelity) — 996 clean, 4 known-hard
  frozen as expected failures.

### Tools
- Draw: Line, Rectangle, Rotated Rectangle, Circle, Polygon, Arc (2-point,
  3-point, centre+angle), Offset, Follow Me (profile swept along a path,
  mitred corners, closed paths weld into lathes).
- Transform: Move, Rotate (protractor), Scale (anchor + factor, negative
  mirrors) — live previews, exact snapshots undo, autofold.
- Select: click (curves/surfaces as wholes), double-click (face + edges),
  triple-click (whole connected solid), window/crossing box, Select All.
- Annotate: Tape Measure with construction guides, Protractor (angled
  guides), Dimensions with styles, terrain profile for geo paths.
- Eraser (click + stroke), Paint with materials, escalating Esc.

### Materials, layers, groups
- Categorised texture library (22 procedural, seamlessly tileable,
  licence-clean textures across 9 civil categories) painted at real-world
  tile size; edit width/height/rotation of any texture, undoably.
- Layers/tags with visibility and locking — top view + parallel projection
  + layers = the plan drawing, no separate 2D module.
- Groups: isolated geometry, edit-inside context (double-click in),
  cross-context undo correctness, face-me billboards.

### BIM (the thesis)
- Tag any faces or group as an IFC object (15 curated classes) — metadata
  over freeform geometry, never rigid primitives.
- Live quantities per object: area always, volume only when watertight.
- Takeoff CSV export — the bridge to IngePresupuestos today.
- **IFC4 export**, hand-written STEP (zero dependencies): spatial skeleton,
  real IFC classes, faceted BRep geometry, BaseQuantities in the file.

### Georeferencing (Track G)
- Local datum + UTM conversion; satellite base maps (Esri/Sentinel-2/custom
  XYZ) with area-limited capture; 3D draped terrain from free global DEM;
  geo paths with longitudinal profiles (stations, slopes, CSV/PNG export);
  KML/GeoJSON import.

### Interchange
- Native `.igz` documents (JSON, versioned).
- Import: COLLADA `.dae` (SketchUp exports, components, Y-up/inches
  conversion), OBJ (+MTL colours), KML/GeoJSON.
- Export: IFC4, STL (3D printing), OBJ (+MTL, textures with UVs).

### Experience
- Bilingual UI (English source, full Spanish), SketchUp-style movable
  icon toolbars, QGIS-style panels (Properties | BIM | Georef tabs),
  sky/ground horizon, paper-white maquette shading with face culling,
  infinite dashed axes.
- Scale figure: the author himself (1.65 m) as a face-me billboard cutout,
  plus generic 2D/3D people, tree, bush, car components — and "insert your
  own transparent PNG at real height".
- Desktop launcher + icon installer (`scripts/install_desktop.sh`);
  the icon is the author's mark: his tri-blade wrapped around the cube.
